Atlas is a chat bot built on the [Hubot][hubot] framework.

[hubot]: https://hubot.github.com/

### Running Atlas Locally

You can test Atlas by running the following.

You can start Atlas locally by running:

    % bin/hubot

You'll see some start up output and a prompt:

    [Sat Feb 28 2015 12:38:27 GMT+0000 (GMT)] INFO Using default redis on localhost:6379
    Atlas>

Then you can interact with Atlas by typing `Atlas help`.

    Atlas> Atlas help
    Atlas animate me <query> - The same thing as `image me`, except adds [snip]
    Atlas help - Displays all of the help commands that Atlas knows about.
    ...

### Scripting

- greetings.coffee
    - It takes care of any hellos goodbyes or intros

##  Persistence

If you are going to use the `hubot-redis-brain` package (strongly suggested),
you will need to add the Redis to Go addon on Heroku which requires a verified
account or you can create an account at [Redis to Go][redistogo] and manually
set the `REDISTOGO_URL` variable.

    % heroku config:add REDISTOGO_URL="..."

If you don't need any persistence feel free to remove the `hubot-redis-brain`
from `external-scripts.json` and you don't need to worry about redis at all.
